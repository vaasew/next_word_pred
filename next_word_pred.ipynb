        "himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\n",
        "armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\n",
        "brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\n",
        "The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\n",
        "any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\n",
        "rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\n",
        "proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\n",
        "its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\n",
        "on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\n",
        "picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\n",
        "housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\n",
        "hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\n",
        "the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\n",
        "rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\n",
        "“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\n",
        "nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\n",
        "because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\n",
        "couldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\n",
        "right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\n",
        "hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\n",
        "floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\n",
        "pain there that he had never felt before.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\n",
        "Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\n",
        "effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\n",
        "the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\n",
        "and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\n",
        "you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\n",
        "all go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\n",
        "slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\n",
        "head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\n",
        "lots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\n",
        "when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\n",
        "back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\n",
        "shudder.\n",
        "\n",
        "He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\n",
        "he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\n",
        "travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\n",
        "back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\n",
        "these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\n",
        "I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\n",
        "But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\n",
        "have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\n",
        "ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\n",
        "him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\n",
        "off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\n",
        "at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\n",
        "especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\n",
        "of hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\n",
        "together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\n",
        "suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\n",
        "change. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\n",
        "five.”\n",
        "\n",
        "And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\n",
        "“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\n",
        "quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\n",
        "quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\n",
        "bed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\n",
        "certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\n",
        "through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\n",
        "peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\n",
        "should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\n",
        "that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\n",
        "still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\n",
        "lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\n",
        "boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\n",
        "five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\n",
        "not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\n",
        "man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\n",
        "sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\n",
        "years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\n",
        "certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\n",
        "company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\n",
        "doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\n",
        "that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\n",
        "would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\n",
        "apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\n",
        "completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\n",
        "\n",
        "He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\n",
        "get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\n",
        "cautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\n",
        "was his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\n",
        "somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\n",
        "voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\n",
        "before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\n",
        "uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\n",
        "at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\n",
        "leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\n",
        "had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\n",
        "circumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\n",
        "thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\n",
        "could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\n",
        "satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\n",
        "conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\n",
        "against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\n",
        "knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\n",
        "Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\n",
        "again with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\n",
        "other side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\n",
        "Do you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\n",
        "making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\n",
        "enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\n",
        "individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\n",
        "whispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\n",
        "no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\n",
        "his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\n",
        "at night even when he was at home.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\n",
        "disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\n",
        "then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\n",
        "would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\n",
        "bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\n",
        "caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\n",
        "imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\n",
        "themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\n",
        "in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\n",
        "which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\n",
        "himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\n",
        "difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\n",
        "would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\n",
        "of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\n",
        "different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\n",
        "he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\n",
        "stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\n",
        "that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\n",
        "painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\n",
        "to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\n",
        "of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\n",
        "imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\n",
        "went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\n",
        "shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\n",
        "the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\n",
        "from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\n",
        "well, at present, be the most sensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\n",
        "carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\n",
        "and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\n",
        "followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\n",
        "got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\n",
        "that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\n",
        "injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\n",
        "same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\n",
        "to stay in bed than lose consciousness.\n",
        "\n",
        "It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\n",
        "but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\n",
        "they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\n",
        "possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\n",
        "chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\n",
        "stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\n",
        "of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\n",
        "though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\n",
        "much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\n",
        "he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\n",
        "could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\n",
        "enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\n",
        "offer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\n",
        "struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\n",
        "he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\n",
        "expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\n",
        "natural state.\n",
        "\n",
        "But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\n",
        "definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\n",
        "will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\n",
        "they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\n",
        "the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\n",
        "at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\n",
        "kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\n",
        "His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\n",
        "it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\n",
        "was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\n",
        "raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\n",
        "was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\n",
        "forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\n",
        "came to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\n",
        "mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\n",
        "their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\n",
        "down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\n",
        "onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\n",
        "Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\n",
        "all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\n",
        "could not suppress a smile at this thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\n",
        "been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\n",
        "was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\n",
        "soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\n",
        "someone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\n",
        "his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\n",
        "For a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\n",
        "Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\n",
        "course, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\n",
        "Gregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\n",
        "knew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\n",
        "only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\n",
        "highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\n",
        "every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\n",
        "and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\n",
        "couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\n",
        "in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\n",
        "of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\n",
        "necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\n",
        "to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\n",
        "only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\n",
        "it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\n",
        "proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\n",
        "There was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\n",
        "softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\n",
        "elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\n",
        "noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\n",
        "it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\n",
        "the carpet.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\n",
        "the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\n",
        "had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\n",
        "had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\n",
        "question, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\n",
        "could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\n",
        "Gregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\n",
        "clerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\n",
        "daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\n",
        "clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\n",
        "early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\n",
        "speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\n",
        "good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\n",
        "clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\n",
        "mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\n",
        "the door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\n",
        "missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\n",
        "makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\n",
        "town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\n",
        "the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\n",
        "idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\n",
        "frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\n",
        "amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\n",
        "soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\n",
        "wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\n",
        "he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\n",
        "he is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\n",
        "and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\n",
        "of the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\n",
        "it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\n",
        "But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\n",
        "become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\n",
        "we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\n",
        "the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\n",
        "impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\n",
        "on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\n",
        "his sister began to cry.\n",
        "\n",
        "So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\n",
        "just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\n",
        "crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\n",
        "clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\n",
        "happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\n",
        "demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\n",
        "yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\n",
        "abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\n",
        "carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\n",
        "have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\n",
        "discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\n",
        "on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\n",
        "And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\n",
        "instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\n",
        "others didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\n",
        "excuse their behaviour.\n",
        "\n",

        "reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\n",
        "down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\n",

        "them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\n",
        "he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\n",
        "had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\n",
        "very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\n",
        "have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\n",
        "took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\n",
        "was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\n",
        "his father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\n",
        "he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\n",
        "of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\n",
        "possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\n",
        "himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\n",
        "see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\n",
        "and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\n",
        "distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\n",
        "unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\n",
        "nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\n",
        "a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\n",
        "was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\n",
        "then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\n",
        "through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\n",
        "obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\n",
        "doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\n",
        "merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\n",
        "as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\n",
        "to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\n",
        "What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\n",
        "all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\n",
        "Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\n",
        "a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\n",
        "without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\n",

        "anyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\n",
        "felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\n",
        "and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\n",
        "shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\n",
        "palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\n",
        "down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\n",
        "the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\n",
        "now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\n",
        "happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\n",
        "stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\n",
        "legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\n",
        "a miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\n",
        "actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\n",
        "something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\n",
        "milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\n",
        "pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\n",
        "that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\n",
        "covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\n",
        "disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\n",
        "difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\n",
        "worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\n",
        "nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\n",
        "had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\n",
        "almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\n",
        "the centre of the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\n",
        "lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\n",
        "with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\n",
        "mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\n",
        "be heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\n",
        "reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\n",
        "was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\n",
        "in the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\n",
        "himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\n",
        "able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\n",
        "parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\n",
        "come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\n",
        "did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\n",
        "crawling up and down the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\n",
        "opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\n",
        "the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\n",
        "room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\n",
        "the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\n",
        "in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\n",
        "no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\n",
        "while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\n",
        "but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\n",
        "clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\n",

        "stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\n",
        "they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\n",
        "into Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\n",
        "to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\n",
        "For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\n",
        "made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\n",
        "had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\n",
        "other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\n",
        "pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\n",
        "his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\n",
        "regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\n",
        "\n",
        "He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\n",
        "sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\n",
        "hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\n",
        "which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\n",
        "he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\n",
        "consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\n",
        "in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\n",
        "as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\n",
        "sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\n",
        "looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\n",
        "did notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\n",
        "he couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\n",
        "herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\n",
        "regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\n",
        "came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\n",
        "even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\n",
        "edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\n",
        "the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\n",

        "good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\n",
        "looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\n",
        "surprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\n",
        "hands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\n",
        "would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\n",
        "never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\n",
        "bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\n",
        "things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\n",
        "vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\n",
        "had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\n",
        "declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\n",
        "with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\n",
        "into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\n",
        "Gregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\n",
        "Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\n",
        "she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\n",
        "Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\n",
        "liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\n",
        "his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\n",
        "difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\n",
        "had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\n",
        "had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\n",
        "used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\n",
        "cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\n",
        "more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\n",
        "his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\n",
        "and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\n",
        "all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\n",
        "from them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\n",
        "finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\n",
        "turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\n",
        "was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\n",
        "hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\n",
        "there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\n",
        "eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\n",
        "hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\n",

        "the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\n",
        "all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\n",
        "into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\n",

        "sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\n",
        "the maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\n",

        "It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\n",

        "nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\n",
        "he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\n",

        "situation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\n",
        "least a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\n",
        "dinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\n",

        "speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\n",
        "whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\n",
        "first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\n",
        "two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\n",
        "should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\n",
        "as there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\n",
        "wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\n",

        "fallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\n",
        "delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\n",
        "she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\n",

        "she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\n",

        "Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\n",
        "to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\n",
        "Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\n",
        "document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\n",
        "it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\n",
        "complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\n",
        "he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\n",

        "time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\n",

        "travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\n",
        "to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\n",
        "work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\n",
        "benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\n",
        "times and they had never come again, at least not with the same\n",
        "splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\n",
        "position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\n",

        "short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\n",
        "the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\n",
        "could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\n",
        "innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\n",

        "Christmas day.\n",
        "\n",
        "That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\n",
        "in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\n",
        "There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\n",
        "when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\n",
        "up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\n",

        "matters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\n",
        "everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\n",
        "learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\n",
        "still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\n",
        "had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\n",
        "Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\n",
        "been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\n",
        "that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\n",
        "with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\n",
        "He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\n",
        "debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\n",

        "\n",
        "This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\n",

        "first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\n",
        "had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\n",

        "horrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\n",

        "seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\n",

        "probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\n",

        "though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\n",
        "and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\n",
        "and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\n",
        "while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\n",
        "she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\n",
        "had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\n",

        "persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\n",
        "approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\n",
        "made her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\n",

        "himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\n",

        "everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\n",

        "everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\n",

        "with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\n",
        "even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\n",
        "unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\n",
        "his boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\n",
        "the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\n",

        "without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\n",
        "of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\n",
        "on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\n",
        "especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\n",
        "did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\n",

        "he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\n",
        "running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\n",
        "slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\n",
        "he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\n",

        "another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\n",
        "no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\n",
        "him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\n",
        "sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\n",
        "one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\n",

        "apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\n",
        "off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\n",
        "it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\n",
        "away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\n",

        "because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\n",
        "forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\n",

        "close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\n",

        "wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\n",
        "attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\n",
        "but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\n",
        "with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\n",
        "intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\n",
        "everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\n",
        "already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\n",
        "anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\n",
        "break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\n",
        "shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\n",

        "entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\n",
        "with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\n",
        "room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\n",
        "body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\n",
        "whether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\n",
        "realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\n",
        "without knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\n",
        "their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\n",
        "towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\n",
        "overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\n",
        "interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\n",
        "limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\n",
        "playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\n",
        "instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\n",
        "breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\n",
        "from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\n",
        "Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\n",
        "flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\n",

        "pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\n",
        "middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\n",
        "and thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\n",
        "now”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\n",

        "with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\n",
        "be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\n",
        "and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\n",

        "seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\n",
        "also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\n",
        "move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\n",

        "understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\n",
        "while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\n",
        "crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\n",
        "word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\n",
        "head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\n",
        "round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\n",
        "to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\n",
        "up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\n",

        "\n",
        "He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\n",
        "bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\n",
        "his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\n",
        "so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\n",
        "forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\n",

        "actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\n",
        "unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\n",
        "entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\n",
        "and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\n",
        "hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\n",
        "it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\n",
        "family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\n",
        "go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\n",
        "of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\n",
        "three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\n",
        "everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\n",
        "head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\n",

        "God for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\n",
        "example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\n",
        "look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\n",
        "out again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\n",

        "without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\n",
        "the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\n",
        "air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\n",

        "the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\n",
        "other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\n",
        "them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\n",
        "only end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\n",
        "Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\n",
        "the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\n",
        "the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\n",
        "positions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\n",
        "Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\n",

        "front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\n",
        "time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\n",
        "jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\n",
        "Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\n",
        "connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\n",
        "from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\n",
        "and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\n",
        "onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\n",
        "intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\n",
        "gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\n",
        "turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\n",
        "few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\n",
        "family lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\n",
        "with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\n",
        "than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\n",
        "went, as if relieved, back into the flat.\n",
        "\n",
        "They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\n",
        "and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\n",
        "they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\n",
        "three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\n",
        "contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\n",
        "were writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\n",
        "that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\n",
        "from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\n",
        "not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\n",
        "asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\n",
        "face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\n",
        "do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\n",
        "feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\n",
        "all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\n",
        "directions. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\n",
        "cleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\n",
        "friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\n",
        "that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\n",
        "rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\n",
        "over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\n",
        "writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\n",
        "everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\n",
        "clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\n",
